## Binance Data Adapter for backtesting.py

This Python function, BinanceBTpy, is designed to adapt data retrieved from the Binance API for use with the backtesting.py library. It retrieves historical price data for a specified symbol and interval from Binance, processes it, and returns a pandas DataFrame ready for use in backtesting trading strategies.

To use this function, simply specify the symbol (default is 'BTCUSDT'), the interval (default is Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1MINUTE), and the desired time period in minutes (time). Ensure that you have your Binance API key and secret ready to configure the function.

# Example usage:

```bash
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from binance.client import Client

data = BinanceBTpy('ETHUSDT', Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_5MINUTE, 999)
```

Feel free to customize the function parameters and integrate it into your backtesting workflow!

You can adjust this introduction as needed to fit your preferences and provide additional details if necessary.
